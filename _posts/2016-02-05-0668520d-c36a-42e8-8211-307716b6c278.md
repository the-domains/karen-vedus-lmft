_**Karen Vedus LMFT  
Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist**_  
Helping
couples reconnect and reduce conflict that creates distance in their 
relationship with the most effective marriage counseling 
approach...Emotionally Focused Couples Therapy (EFT).

While using EFT as my treatment
approach I have
successfully guided couples to regain trust, communication, and the love
they thought they had lost in their relationship. Many of my clients 
are referrals from other clients and couples who have researched the 
most effective couples treatment and discovered EFT. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/c718596f-92f9-4e31-bf3a-386cd295afce.png)

Research 
has shown that EFT is highly effective. "Seven out of 10 distressed 
couples \[who seek EFT\] show marked improvement, move out of distress and
stay there," Blum said. (

**Research on the success of EFT:**

EFT appears
to move couples from distress to recovery for 70 to 75% of the cases, 
and creates improvements in 90% of the couples coming in for 
therapy. EFT has been used with many different types of couples in 
private practice, university training centers and hospital clinics. 
These distressed couples include partners suffering from disorders such 
as depression, post-traumatic stress and chronic illness.
